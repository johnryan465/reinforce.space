## Magnetorquers

Passing a current through a loop of a conductor in a magnetic field will create a magnetic dipole moment.





$\mu$ is the __magnetic dipole moment__.

$A$ is the area of the loop. $(m^2)$

$\hat{n}$ is the unit vector perpendicular to the loop, (direction is determined by the right hand rule).

$I$ is the current $(A)$.

$$\mu = I A \hat{n}$$


$B$ is the __magnetic field__.


$\tau$ is the __torque__ on the loop.

$\tau = \mu \times B$
