## ICRF Frame

This is an inertial frame which is defined relative to extra galactic sources.


## J2000 Frame

This is an inertial frame which is defined by the J2000 epoch, and the mean equator and equinox at that point.

The ICRF frame was designed to almost exactly correspond to the the J2000 frame.

## True Equator, Mean Equinox Frame


## Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) Frame

__Earth Centered Inertial Frame__ is a global reference frame, which is commonly used for satellites.

This frame is centered at the earths center, but does not rotate with the earth.

## Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF) Frame

This frame is centered at the earths center, and does rotate with the earth. This is a non inertial reference frame.

## Body Fixed Reference Frame

This is a reference frame where the coordinates are fixed with respect to some body. In our case this will be the satellite body. This will be a non inertial reference frame.

## Transformations


Some of the forces will be easier to specify in one particular frame, and some in others. We can transform between these.
