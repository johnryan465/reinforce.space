## Reaction Wheels

CubeSats often have __reaction wheels__ as one of their form of actuation. Reaction wheels rotate the spacecraft around the the center of mass. 

They operate using the principle of conservation of angular momentum. They angular momentum of both the satillite body and the reaction wheels must be conserved.

There is no external torque possible. As reaction wheels have a max rotation rate, they can be saturated and not provide any additional force after a certain point. Ideally reaction wheels should be combined with a different system which can apply external torque such as magnetoquers.



$L$ is the angular momentum.

- $L = I \omega$
- $I$ is the moment of inertia
- $\omega$ is the angular velocity.


Each of the reaction wheels will have the same moment of inertia.



We do this seperately with respect the the 3 axis.


$$L_{total} = L_{body} + L_{wheels}$$
