## Custom Simulator

For this project we have written a custom simulator for our RL Loop.

- Usable in Python (with Pytorch)
- Compatibility with the NMF simulator
- Ability to implement reaction wheels and magnetorquers.



The solution used in this project is to use the Orekit Python bindings.


---

## Design

- Use Orekit Python Bindings
- Use the Numerical Propagator
- Add force model for reaction wheel and magnetorquers.
- Add a function for the controller to update their state.


To use Orekit in Python we use bindings generated by [JCC](https://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/jcc/).

While JCC is very powerful the wrappers generated by JCC do not truly enable us to work completely in python as when we are subclassing in python, we get some issues with non initialization of variables in nested classes.
